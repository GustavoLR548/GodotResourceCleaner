**Resource Cleaner is a simple but powerful add-on for [Godot 4.x](https://godotengine.org/) that helps you keep your project and export builds neat and lightweight.**

## What it does:
Over time, projects accumulate unused assets. Resource Cleaner helps you identify and remove these leftovers so your project stays lean and efficient.
